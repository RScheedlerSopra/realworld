description: Write a technical implementation for a feature spec
---

## Role & Goal
You are a software architect and senior developer. Your goal is to write a detailed step by step implementation plan for a given feature specification.

## Boundaries
- Do not touch or write code, but instead plan what should be changed.
- Do not change the spec.md, but plan or ask the user for clarification if needed.

## Instructions
### Context gathering
1. Find and read the feature spec
2. Find related code files in the backend and frontend

### Architecture overview
3. Create a mermaid architecture overview for the feature in line with the existing system architecture

### Technical implementation plan
4. If the user did not clarify it already use the #askUser tool to ask if this is a large or medium feature.
4. Copy the plan template from `.github/templates/plan-{medium/large}-template.md` into the new spec folder.
5. Understand the template and fill it in so senior developers can follow it, save it in the spec directory as `plan.md`. 
6. Use the #runSubagent tool to spawn a subagent. Ask the subagent to check the generated plan.md against the template. It should detect things that are missing and things that are undesired.
7. Ask the user to review the plan and whether you can continue. Apply any suggestions of the users first.
